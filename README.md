# 🧠 LogSage — AI-Powered Log Analyzer and Root Cause Analysis Agent

LogSage is a tool that lets you upload logs and get intelligent summaries of errors and likely root causes — powered by an LLM running locally or remotely.

## 📷 Demo

## 🚀 Features

- 📂 **Upload Log Files**: `.log` or `.txt` — web server, system, app logs, etc.
- 🔍 **Error Extraction**: Filters log content to highlight relevant warnings, exceptions, and errors.
- 🧠 **LLM Analysis**: Produces a short root cause summary and suggestions based on the log.

## 🧠 How It Works

- Uses a **system prompt** to guide the LLM into behaving like a log analyst
- Extracts lines with keywords like `"error"`, `"warn"`, `"fail"`, `"exception"`
- Summarizes and explains the issue in plain English

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) or [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/)
- Python, requests

## 📦 Local Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/logsage.git
cd logsage
streamlit run app.py
```

## 📁 Sample Logs

You can test with:
- Synthetic logs (generated by LLMs)
- Real web/app/system logs
- Public issue tracker logs

## 🧭 Future Vision

LogSage aims to become an agentic AI system administrator assistant : 
- 🖥️ MCP Agent Integration: Automatically pull logs from the system via an MCP server
- 🤖 Agentic Chain-of-Thought: Multistep reasoning to isolate deeper infrastructure problems
- 🔄 Live Log Streaming Support: Real-time log tailing + LLM insights
- 🧬 Semantic Root Cause Graphing: Link symptoms, errors, systems, and resolutions
- 🗂️ Cross-log Correlation: Compare logs across services, servers, or microservices
- 🔐 SOC/DevOps Integration: APIs for Jira, PagerDuty, Grafana alerts
